2022/11/03 2:14:21 PM EST,Grandma’s Coffee Cake and Rolls,Yes - need Rena review,Grandma,Breakfast,30 minutes,6-8 pans,4 hours,"To make the dough: 

1 quart warm milk, 1 package of active yeast, 1/3 cup warm water, 1 T. salt, 1 cup Crisco-melted, 1 cup sugar, 10-12 cups flour

","To make dough: 

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Add yeast to the warm water and let sit. Using an electric mixer put sugar, salt, Crisco, milk, and yeast mixture into the bowl. Add in 4 cups of flour to start with. Mix on low speed. Keep adding more flour as it continues to mix (up to the 10-12 cups needed).  When done, the dough should not be sticky. Leave the dough in the bowl and pat down so it is level inside. Then grease the top of the dough and sides of the bowl with Crisco. Turn the oven off. Put a towel over the top of the bowl and put in the oven to let rise until doubled in size. (About 2 hours).

To make coffee cake:

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Grease 11x7 pans (about 4-5) with Crisco. Melt 4 sticks of butter. Take the dough out of the oven and punch the middle to let the dough fall down. Take out a softball sized handful of dough (more dough=thicker coffee cake). Roll out on a floured surface until it is able to fit into the pan. Spread the melted butter over the top of the dough (about ¼ c butter for each pan). Then sprinkle the *cinnamon and sugar mixture on top (however much you want-we like a lot). Turn the oven off. Put pans in the oven to let rise to double in size-may need to pile on top of each other to get them all to fit in the oven.
* 2 cups of sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon of cinnamon


To make rolls:

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Then scoop about ¼ c of the melted butter into the bottom of each round pan (4-5 pans). Sprinkle ¼ to 1/3 c of brown sugar into each pan on top of the butter. More sugar=more caramel. Then take a softball sized handful of dough and roll it out into a thin rectangle on a floured surface. Put a layer of melted butter on the rolled out dough. Then sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar mixture on top. Then roll the dough up like a log. Cut the log into 1 inch rolls and put the rolls into the pan about ¼ to ½ inch apart. Turn the oven off. Put pans in the oven to let rise to double in size-may need to pile on top of each other to get them all to fit in the oven.

To bake:

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Rolls and coffee cake should bake for about 10-12 minutes. Usually do 5-6 minutes and then switch the pans from top to bottom in the oven. When they are done, you should be able to shake the pan and they should be a little loose.
